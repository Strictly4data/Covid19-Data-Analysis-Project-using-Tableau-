#                     Project Brief
Design your own COVID-19 dashboard for a country of your choice
Now that you have the skill to create quick dashboards on Tableau. Let’s design
dashboard only applicable to a country of your choice.
It will be beneficial for you to choose a country which already has substantial COVID-19
cases.
It will also be great for your own learning to build this dashboard new, from scratch. So,
start a new workbook on Tableau and connect to the data source!
Requirements:
1. Connect to the official Tableau COVID-19 datasets.
2. Review the mock up dashboard on the next page. You will need to crate the
following:
a. A headline card representing total cases of the country
b. A headline card representing total deaths of the country
c. A headline card representing mortality rate of the country
d. A line graph showing confirmed cases per day
e. A line graph showing confirmed deaths per day
f. A bar chart/line graph showing the mortality rate per day
g. A pie chart showing the cases confirmed and deaths per day
3. When you’re done with your dashboard click on “Server” and publish to Tableau
Public or github repository.
4. Upload a screenshot of your dashboard and a link to your Tableau Public
dashboard so everyone taking the course can see your work!

tableau window!
4. In addition to the mock-
