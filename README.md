#                     Project Brief
Design your own COVID-19 dashboard for a country of your choice
Now that you have the skill to create quick dashboards on Tableau. Let‚Äôs design
dashboard only applicable to a country of your choice.
It will be beneficial for you to choose a country which already has substantial COVID-19
cases.
It will also be great for your own learning to build this dashboard new, from scratch. So,
start a new workbook on Tableau and connect to the data source!
Requirements:
1. Connect to the official Tableau COVID-19 datasets.
2. Review the mock up dashboard on the next page. You will need to crate the
following:
# a. A headline card representing total cases of the country
![A headline card representing total cases of the country](A headline card representing total cases of the country)

# b. A headline card representing total deaths of the country

# c. A headline card representing mortality rate of the country

# d. A line graph showing confirmed cases per day

# e. A line graph showing confirmed deaths per day

# f. A bar chart/line graph showing the mortality rate per day
![ A bar chart/line graph showing the mortality rate per day](https://github.com/Strictly4data/Covid19-Data-Analysis-Project-using-Tableau-/blob/main/Mortal%20per_day.png)

# g. A pie chart showing the cases confirmed and deaths per day
![A pie chart showing the cases confirmed and deaths per day](https://github.com/Strictly4data/Covid19-Data-Analysis-Project-using-Tableau-/blob/main/confirmeddeaths.png)

3. When you‚Äôre done with your dashboard click on ‚ÄúServer‚Äù and publish to Tableau
Public or github repository.

4. Upload a screenshot of your dashboard and a link to your Tableau Public
dashboard so everyone taking the course can see your work!


# Some pointers
1. Remember to filter on date = ‚Äúyesterday‚Äù
2. For Mortality rate, remember it‚Äôs a two-step process. Step 1 is to calculate deaths
as its own separate field. Step 2 will be to calculate the mortality rate which is:
### sum(Deaths)/ sum(Cases) 
3. For a pie chart, remember to use the ‚ÄúShow me‚Äù panel on the right of the
tableau window!
4. In addition to the mock-
